# Help-desk-Ticket System

This is a fullstack application build on Next.js.  The templating language EJS was used and was styled with tailwind css and css customizations. Mongo DB alongside moongoose were used to store variables

## Optimizations

1. Timestamp Formatting:
Implement user-friendly timestamp formats, such as "DD-MM-YYYY HH
" or "relative time" (e.g., "2 hours ago").
2. Card Background Colors:
Differentiate tickets with distinct background colors based on their status for better visual recognition.

3. UI Color Scheme Overhaul:
Redesign the color scheme for a more cohesive and visually appealing interface.

## Coding Practice Optimizations

1. Code Quality Enhancements
Consistent File Formatting:
Ensure all files are uniformly formatted using a linter (e.g., ESLint) for consistent code style and cleanliness.
2. Clarify EditMode:
Clearly document the purpose and implementation of EDITMODE for better understanding and maintainability.

3. Consistent Practices:
Standardize naming and spacing conventions across the codebase for consistency.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
